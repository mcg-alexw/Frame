Frame started as a lightweight terminal-first IDE. It's evolving into a full platform for developing and managing larger projects with AI agents — bringing structure, context, and organization to the way you work with Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

## The Problem

As projects grow with AI agents, things fall apart fast:

- **Context loss** — every new session starts from scratch, you re-explain the same things over and over
- **No project memory** — AI doesn't know your architecture, past decisions, or pending tasks
- **No standard** — every developer structures their AI projects differently, making collaboration and onboarding painful
- **Sessions bleed into each other** — working on multiple projects means context gets mixed up
- **Terminal chaos** — multiple windows, scattered sessions, no organization
- **Tool fragmentation** — Claude, Codex, and Gemini each work differently

These problems are manageable on small projects. On larger ones, they become blockers.

Frame solves all of this.

## How Frame Works

### One Standard, Every Project, Every AI Tool

Frame brings a consistent structure to every project you work on. When you initialize Frame in a project, it creates:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Project rules and instructions — AI reads this automatically |
| `STRUCTURE.json` | Module map with intentIndex for fast file lookup |
| `PROJECT_NOTES.md` | Architectural decisions and context that persist across sessions |
| `tasks.json` | Task tracking with status, context, and acceptance criteria |

Every project gets its own isolated session — its own context, its own task list, its own notes. Switching projects in Frame means switching to a completely fresh, project-specific AI context. No bleed-over, no confusion.

This standard works with any AI tool. Claude Code and Gemini CLI read these files natively. For Codex CLI, Frame injects them automatically via a wrapper script — no manual setup needed.

The result: any developer (or AI agent) who opens a Frame project immediately knows where everything is and what's been decided. Onboarding a new AI session to a large project takes seconds, not minutes.

### Git Commit as the Context Anchor

One of the hardest problems in agentic development is knowing *when* to capture context. Session boundaries are fuzzy — you might stay in the same session for hours. Task completion is ambiguous — agents don't always signal clearly when something is done. Trying to detect "important moments" mid-session is unreliable.

Frame's approach: **use git commits as the single reliable boundary.**

When you commit, something real happened. It's intentional, it's deterministic, and it's a natural checkpoint you're already making. Frame builds its entire context system around this moment:

- **STRUCTURE.json** — auto-updated via pre-commit hook, always reflects the current architecture
- **tasks.json** — task state syncs at commit time
- **PROJECT_NOTES.md** — the right moment to capture what changed and why

When the next session starts, these files are read automatically. The agent picks up exactly where things left off — not from a vague session transcript, but from structured, up-to-date context written at the one moment you can be certain something real was completed.

> **The practical implication:** commit often. Small, intentional commits aren't just good git hygiene — in Frame, they're how context stays accurate and agents stay oriented.

### Spec-Driven Development

For features that won't fit in one session, Frame ships a built-in spec workflow. Each spec is four markdown files on disk:

```
.frame/specs/<slug>/
  spec.md      what we're building
  plan.md      how we'll build it
  tasks.md     broken-down work
  outcome.md   what actually shipped
```

Describe what you want and the AI drafts the spec. `/spec.plan` produces an implementation plan. `/spec.tasks` breaks the plan into discrete tasks that import into `tasks.json` (tagged with `source: "spec:<slug>:T<n>"`). `/spec.implement` walks them one by one — and after each task, the agent appends 2-3 sentences to `outcome.md`: what shipped, what diverged from the plan, what to follow up on.

That last file is the move that makes the rest worth doing. Plans tell you intent. Code tells you reality. `outcome.md` tells you the *story* between them, written while the agent's memory was fresh — the kind of context that's normally lost the moment a session ends.

Two principles shaped this:

- **Files over databases.** Markdown is canonical. Any AI tool can read it without Frame, any teammate can grep it, git versions it, PRs review it.
- **Optional, never forced.** Spec-driven dev isn't every project's shape. Frame asks once when you open the Specs panel; you opt in or skip. Existing `tasks.json` workflows are untouched.

### Agent Orchestration

Specs make features durable. Orchestration makes them **parallel.**

Open the Orchestrator and hand a **conductor** agent several ready specs. It runs them at the same time — each spec in its own **git worktree**, worked by its own agent, fully isolated. No two agents fighting over the same files, no half-finished work bleeding into your working tree.

The conductor doesn't guess at safety. Before running anything it reads each spec's declared **footprint** (the files it will touch) and only parallelizes specs that don't overlap; the rest are serialized. That guard is enforced in Frame's code, not left to the model — a spec whose footprint collides with in-flight work is refused, not merged into chaos.

The unit of parallelism is the **spec**, not the task. A spec's own tasks are interdependent, so one agent runs them in order; *different* specs are the independent units that fan out. Need more parallelism? Split the work into more specs.

When you dispatch a spec, Frame sets up its sandbox automatically — you don't run a single git command:

- a fresh **git worktree** at `.frame/worktrees/<slug>`, branched from current `HEAD` (so serialized specs build on already-merged work),
- a dedicated **work branch** `frame/<slug>/work`,
- a worker **frame** (terminal) launched in that worktree, with the agent started and the spec's prompt injected.

Every worker carries a live **state** you watch on the pipeline rail: `queued → running → done → approved`, with `blocked` (footprint conflict — held until its predecessor merges), `idle`, and `failed` surfaced too. Each worker is a real frame — click it to drop into its terminal, answer an approval prompt, or take over by hand. When you tear a session down, Frame removes the worktrees and prunes merged branches but **keeps un-merged work** on its branch, so nothing is lost.

You stay in control of what lands:

- Workers commit only to their own branch — they never push, never merge, never touch shared files (`tasks.json`, `STRUCTURE.json`, …).
- When a worker finishes, the conductor reviews it and tells you it's ready — it does **not** merge on its own.
- You review (you can test right in the worktree), then **Approve**. Frame runs a **drift check** — what the agent *actually* changed vs. what it *declared* — and merges locally into a per-spec integration branch. `main` is never touched; promoting it or opening a PR stays your call.

It all lives on one screen: the **conductor's terminal** (talk to it directly), the **pipeline rail** across the top, your **worker lanes**, and the **spec rail** to assign more — a cockpit, not a black box. Because no real task finishes in one shot and an agent may need your approval mid-run, you can always step into any frame and keep working by hand.

> **Honest framing:** this is *guardrailed, human-steered* parallelism — not fire-and-forget automation. The conductor proposes and isolates; you decide what merges. That's the point.

### Fast File Lookup

Instead of scanning the entire codebase, Frame's `intentIndex` maps concepts to files:

```bash
node scripts/find-module.js github    # → githubManager.js + githubPanel.js
node scripts/find-module.js terminal  # → all terminal-related files
node scripts/find-module.js --list    # → all features and their files
```

This means AI agents spend zero time searching — they go directly to the right file.

### Multi-AI Support

Switch between AI tools without leaving Frame:

- **Claude Code** — reads `CLAUDE.md` natively (symlink to AGENTS.md)
- **Codex CLI** — wrapper script at `.frame/bin/codex` injects AGENTS.md as initial prompt
- **Gemini CLI** — reads `GEMINI.md` natively
